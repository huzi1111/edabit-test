## Git
  - git add . : We have to navigate to our project directory and type the command git init to initialize a Git repository for our local project folder. Git will create a hidden .git directory and use it for keeping its files organized in other subdirectories.
  - git commit -m "meesage of commit title of commit": This command records or snapshots files permanently in the version history. All the files, which are there in the directory right now, are being saved in the Git file system.
  - git push:  Suppose, we have made some changes in the file and want to push the changes to our remote repository on a particular branch. By using the command ‘git push,’ the local repository’s files can be synced with the remote repository on Github.
  - git pull: The git pull command first runs ‘git fetch’ which downloads the content from the specified remote repository and then immediately updates the local repo to match the content.
